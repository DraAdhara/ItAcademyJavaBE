/*@Repository serves as a specialization of @Component, it also enables annotated classes to be discovered and
registered with the application context.

@Component is an annotation that allows Spring to automatically detect our custom beans.

In other words, without having to write any explicit code, Spring will:

Scan our application for classes annotated with @Component
Instantiate them and inject any specified dependencies into them
Inject them wherever needed
However, most developers prefer to use the more specialized stereotype annotations to serve this function.

@Repository
public interface IFruitaRepository extends JpaRepository<Fruita, Integer> {
}

//Now we can use JpaRepositoryâ€™s methods without implementing these methods.
